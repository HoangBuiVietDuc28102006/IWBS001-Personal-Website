                    <h2>Hanoi</h2>
                    <p>Hanoi is a city that is proudly and entirely Vietnamese, despite centuries of French and Chinese
                        influence. From the Old Quarter, which has French colonial structures, to the more than 600 temples
                        and pagodas scattered around the city, its complex past is evident wherever you look. At places like
                        the Ho Chi Minh Mauseoleum and Hoa Lo Prison, you may go straight to the city's history. Experience
                        it all on foot (or by scooter), allowing time for stops at some of the more recent additions to the
                        city, such as independent art galleries, boutique stores, and hip cafés. You're not the only one
                        that is here for the food. While banh mi and bun cha are undoubtedly essential, make time for
                        additional street food favourites like shrimp cakes, stir-fried eel, crispy crepes, and a few cold
                        beers to wash it all down.</p>
                    <p>I love this place because Hanoi was the place where I lived and I had a lot of memories there with my family and friends.</p>

                    <h2>Nghe An</h2>
                    <p>Nghe An, Vietnam, which is around 291 kilometres south of Hanoi, attracts visitors with a variety of travel methods that suit their requirements, including exploration and spiritual tourism. Visitors to Nghe An may explore historical treasures, ecological zones, zoos with a variety of rare species, picturesque beaches, and ecological tourism places where they can connect with nature.</p>
                    <p>I love Nghe An because this is where my ancestors live. Every year, my family and I come back here to visit our distant relatives. Even though we haven't seen each other for a long time, we always treat each other like family.</p>

                    <h2>Nha Trang</h2>
                    <p>The most famous feature of Nha Trang is its stunning sandy beaches. However, there are also a number of hotels and dining options, mud spas, golf, the old Po Ngar temple complex, and amusement parks. While the region's fresh seafood, noodles, and pancakes are popular with most people, adventurous diners can try bun cha ca, a soup prepared from sailfish and jellyfish.</p>
                    <p>I love Nha Trang because of its its beautiful beaches, vibrant culture, and delicious food.</p>

                    <h2>Quang Ninh</h2>
                    <p>Vietnam's northeastern coast is home to one of the largest provinces, Quang Ninh. Quang Ninh's moniker, "Secure Serenity," somehow conveys a lot about that serene and breathtaking country. The renowned Ha Long Bay, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is located there and is part of the province's capital, Ha Long City.</p>
                    <p>I once had the opportunity to climb Yen Tu Mountain, although it was quite high, I successfully climbed to the top of it. I really like the air there, very fresh, airy and cool.</p>

                    <h2>Hoi An</h2>
                    <p>Hoi An Ancient Town is a famous city of Quang Nam province, an ancient town that has been kept almost intact with more than 1000 architectural relics from streets, houses, assembly halls, communal houses, pagodas, temples, clan churches, ancient wells... to traditional dishes, the soul of the people here. A trip to Hoi An will captivate visitors with its timeless beauty, extremely rustic and simple.</p>
                    <p>I loveHoi An for its magical blend of ancient charm, vibrant lantern-lit streets, and delicious cuisine, all set against a backdrop of rich culture and riverside beauty.</p>

                    <h2>Sapa</h2>
                    <p>In the middle of a demanding mountain hike or rice-paddy trip, the vibrant and quaint market town of Sapa in the north-west offers the ideal respite. As a reminder of the town's French missionary heritage, the Gothic stone church in the middle of the town stands out among the stores and booths. In addition to enjoying Vietnamese or European-inspired dining downtown, make sure to attend the Saturday night "love market," which is one of the most powerful—and rigid—single-night events in the world.</p>
                    <p>
                        I love Sapa for its stunning terraced rice fields, cool mountain air, and the rich traditions of its welcoming hill tribe communities.</p>

                <h2>Hoan Kiem Lake</h2>
                <p>Many residents and visitors love this well-known lake almost as much as a rare species of turtle. With its many retail and sightseeing options nearby, Hoan Kiem Lake offers a vibrant everyday scene, from morning strolls with residents exercising on the beach to young couples watching the lake from park seats.  Hoan Kiem Lake, which is a huge home base and offers countless chances for leisure and people-watching on the outskirts of the Old Quarter, is conveniently positioned in the city.</p>
                <p>I like Hoan Kiem Lake because it is where my friends often meet. Lots of wonderful memories.</p>

                <p>Anyone who comes to Nghe An, remember to visit Uncle Ho's hometown Sen village. There are simple thatched roofs, under the shady green bamboo hedges, the sound of mother's weaving loom in the hot summer afternoon, and the scent of lotus flowers spreading throughout the sky. Those are the images that once accompanied President Ho Chi Minh - Nghe An tourist destination</p>
                <p>Every year when I return to Nghe An, my grandparents take me to visit the simple house where Uncle Ho used to live. Although I don’t know how many times I have been there, I always look forward to going back one day.</p>

                <p>The 85,754-hectare Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park was added to the World Heritage List in 2003. With this expansion, the site's total surface area has increased by 46% to 123,326 hectares, and it now borders the Hin Namno Nature Reserve in the PDR Laos. Tropical woods and limestone plateaux make up the Park's terrain. Numerous caverns and subterranean rivers are among the amazing phenomena it provides, along with a significant deal of geological variety. Numerous indigenous species and a high degree of biodiversity may be found at the location. In addition to giving the catchment areas—which are crucial for maintaining the integrity of limestone landscapes—greater protection, the expansion guarantees a more cohesive ecology.</p>

                    An interesting display of the president's palace in the last few years prior to reunification of the country in 1975. Was pouring outside so we decided to go somewhere to get out of the rain. The palace was on our list, but it turned into one of the best places to visit. I spend a great time in here.
                    It is a best historic place. It was the site of the end of the Vietnam War during the Fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975, when a North Vietnamese Army tank crashed through its gates.</p>
